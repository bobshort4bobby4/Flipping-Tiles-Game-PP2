# Introduction
This project is the second one I've undertaken as part of the Full Stack Software Diploma course at [Codeinstitute.net](https://www.CodeInstitute.net).

It is a version of the kids memory card game, familiar to most people.  The aim is to turn the cards over in pairs and 
note the position of the various icons on the face side, if they match they are  left face-side up, if not matched they
are flipped back to blank-side up.  The game is won when all the pairs are found.  The game will have two difficulty levels and options to toggle the music and soundfx.  



Memory games have been shown to greatly help children develop key skills. Brain functions such as focus, attention and concentration
are improved by games such as this one. Visual recognition is also improved as is both short-term and long-term memory.  
Adults also can greatly benefit from 'exercising' the brain, as any activity which encourages mental activity maintains and
can improve mental function.
